🔑 Some interesting projects I made:
<br>
1. Smart Traffic Monitoring (Computer Vision & AI)
Built an AI system that spots speed violations on the road in real time, helping cut down on infractions and serving as a kind of speed bump camera. (OpenCV, Yolo, MQTT, Math)
2. Crowd Analytics for Big Events (Deep Learning)
Created a computer vision app that tracks and counts people at concerts and festivals using drones and deep learning models. (CSR-Net, DMCount, Bayesian)
3. Sign Language Translation (Deep Learning)
Developed a tool that translates Brazilian Sign Language (LIBRAS) into Portuguese text. I also built the reverse part: a text-to-sign system that generates full gesture videos using OpenPose and Mediapipe, translating text into sign language gestures.
4. Big Data Analysis with AWS
Worked with Redshift + S3 to run queries and analysis on over 500 million rows of data. Made data pipelines faster and way more efficient.
5. AI Chatbots & Virtual Assistants
Built several chatbots and virtual assistants for e-commerce businesses, startups, and other companies, helping them handle customer questions, automate responses, and improve user engagement.
